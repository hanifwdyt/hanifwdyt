I've been thinking about the difference between systems that execute and systems that think.

Most software does exactly what you tell it to. Give it the same input, get the same output. Reliable. Predictable. Dead.

But the best systems have memory. They learn. They adapt. Not through machine learning necessarily—sometimes just through thoughtful design. A cache is a memory. A rate limiter is learning from the past. A/B tests are evolution.

The question isn't "what should this system do?" but "how should this system learn what to do?"

That shift changes everything.
