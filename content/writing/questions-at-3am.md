excerpt: "When sleep won't come and thoughts spiral into questions without answers."

Why do I question everything?
Is questioning a search for truth or a way to avoid commitment?

If I pursue logic in code and emotion in poetry,
where do I put the things that are both?

What impossible thing am I dreaming of today?
Is it impossible because it can't be done,
or because I'm afraid to try?

When I write, am I creating or discovering?
When I run, am I chasing or fleeing?

And why, at 3 AM, do these questions feel urgent,
when by morning they'll seem obvious or silly or both?
