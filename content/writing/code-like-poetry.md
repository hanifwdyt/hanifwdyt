excerpt: "Both are about finding the right abstraction, the perfect name, the cleanest expression."

Code and poetry have more in common than you'd think.

Both are about **compression**—saying the most with the least. Both obsess over names. Both care about rhythm and flow. Both can be beautiful or ugly, elegant or clumsy.

## The Difference

The difference is the audience. Poetry speaks to humans. Code speaks to machines that serve humans.

But the best code speaks to both.

When you read well-written code, you don't just understand *what* it does—you understand *why*. The structure reveals intent. The names tell a story. The flow feels inevitable.

That's not engineering. That's poetry.
