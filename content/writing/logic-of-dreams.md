excerpt: "What happens when you apply systematic thinking to impossible goals?"

People say I'm a dreamer. They mean it as a warning.

But I dream in systems. My impossible ideas come with architecture diagrams and dependency graphs. I don't just imagine outcomes—I map the paths to get there.

Maybe that's why they call it impossible. Not because it can't be done, but because they can't see the steps. They see the gap between here and there and call it a chasm.

I see a series of small, logical leaps.

The logic of dreams is this: break impossible into improbable, improbable into difficult, difficult into merely hard. Then ship it.
