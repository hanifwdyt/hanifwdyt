A simple tool to track swimming workouts and visualize progress.

## Background

I swim regularly, but I'm not competitive. I just want to show up consistently and gradually improve. Most swim tracking apps are built for serious athletes with complicated training plans.

I needed something simpler.

## Features

- Log distance, time, and stroke type
- Track consistency (days swam per week/month)
- Visualize trends over time
- Calculate pace improvements
- Set simple goals

## Design Decisions

Everything is stored locally. No account needed. Data exports to CSV if you want to analyze it elsewhere.

The UI is intentionally minimal—just charts and a form. No gamification, no social features. Just data.

## Impact

I've been using it for over a year. It helped me go from swimming once a week to 3-4 times. Not because of motivation tricks, but because seeing the consistency pattern made me want to maintain it.

Simple systems work.
