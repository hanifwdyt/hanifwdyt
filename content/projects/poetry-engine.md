An experiment in using algorithms to generate poetry that doesn't suck.

## The Idea

Most generative text is either too random (nonsense) or too structured (boring). I wanted to find the sweet spot—something that feels human but surprises you.

## The Approach

Instead of using large language models, I went old school: Markov chains with custom weights based on phonetic patterns, emotional valence, and rhythm.

The system learns from a corpus of poems I actually like, then generates variations that maintain the "feel" while creating new combinations.

## Results

Sometimes it produces garbage. Sometimes it produces lines that make me pause and think "did I write that or did the machine?"

That ambiguity is the point.

Still experimental. Not sure where this goes, but it's fun to explore.
