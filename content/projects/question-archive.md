A digital garden for questions that don't have simple answers.

## Why This Exists

I ask a lot of questions. Some are technical ("How do you design a rate limiter?"). Some are philosophical ("What does it mean to build something meaningful?"). Some are both.

I used to scatter these across notebooks, notes apps, and browser tabs. This is an attempt to organize them.

## How It Works

Each question is a page. Each page has:
- The question
- My current answer (which evolves over time)
- Related questions
- Sources and references
- A history of how my thinking has changed

It's built with Next.js and MDX so I can version control my thoughts and see how they evolve over time.

## The Value

It's not really for anyone else. It's for me in 6 months when I forget why I thought something was important.

But if someone else finds it useful, cool.
