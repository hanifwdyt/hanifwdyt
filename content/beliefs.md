## Long game: direction > speed

- Know where you're going first
- Right path saves you tons of time
- Less distraction, more progress
- Slow and aimed beats fast and lost

## Short game: ship fast, think less

- Overthinking = fear
- Action gives you answers
- Done is better than perfect
- Speed unlocks clarity

## Consistency is investing in yourself

- Daily reps compound over time
- Make it fun, not a chore
- Show up, let the results follow

## Time & attention > everything

- Attention is the real currency — Naval Ravikant
- Productive mind pays the best returns
- Measure everything against your time
- Procrastinating = wasting your money
